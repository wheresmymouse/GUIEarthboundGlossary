# GUIEarthboundGlossary
A GUI for an Earthbound-centric glossary program for SDEV-140.

The program consists of two windows.
The first window has an entry box, a SUBMIT BUTTON, a definition bar, an EXIT button, corresponding labels and a picture.
When the EXIT button is pressed, a second window will appear prompting the user to confirm that they want to close the program.
The second window has a label and two buttons, YES or NO.
If the user selects YES, both windows close.
If the user selects NO, just the second window closes and the main window can still be used.
