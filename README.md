# GUIEarthboundGlossary
A GUI for an Earthbound-centric glossary program for SDEV-140.

I still need to complete the link so the photograph will actually appear.
I need to add more keys to the dictionary - I just added four or five for initial testing.
For some reason, the program fails to load the other widgets because it cannot find the photo I specified.
They load if you cut that photo-specific block of text out, though.
I need to fix the submit button so it actually calls the definitions the way it is supposed to.
I need to find a way to justify a second window.
I need to find a way to justify a third button.
I need to split the code into modules.  Perhaps the dictionary could have its own module.
